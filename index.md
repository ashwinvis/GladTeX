GladTeX
=======

About
-----

GladTeX is a utility and library to display mathematics on the Web (and in
offline formats, too). Formulas are embedded within `<eq>…</eq>` tags and
converted automatically to a scalable SVG image using LaTeX. The images
integrate seamlessly into the output documents, work with any browser and are
accessible for visually impaired and blind users as well.

Features
--------

-   LaTeX-quality formulas with partial unicode maths support
-   [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) support to convert from any format with
    LaTeX-formulas (MarkDown, …) to any HTML-based format, e.g. EPUB
-   Cache formulas to speed up subsequent document conversion
-   Python library GleeTeX to embed into other applications or to tailor to a
    specific workflow
-   cross-platform, written in Python, comes with Windows executables.
-   tested and documented source code
